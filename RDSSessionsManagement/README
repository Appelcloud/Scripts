-EnableNewSessions: Which enables New connections on all session hosts provided in the Sessionshosts.txt file

-DisableNewSessions: Which disables all New Connections on all sessions hosts provided in the Sessionshosts.txt file

When running -DisableNewSessions a mandatory Parameter called -Disconnect asks if you want to Disconnect All sesssions on the hosts or only Disconnected sesssions.

-Disconnect All/Disconnected

The Script needs to look at a SessionsHosts.txt file that has a line seperated .txt file. Be sure to change the $servers variable in the script to the given hosts file
